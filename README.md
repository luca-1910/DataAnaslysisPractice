# 🧪 Data Analysis, Cleaning & Visualization - Practical Activities

This repository contains practical exercises and mini-projects related to **Data Analysis**, **Data Cleaning**, and **Data Visualization** carried out during my Bachelor of Information and Communication Technology.

These activities reflect hands-on work with real-world datasets, showcasing essential data handling skills using Python and various libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and more.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn (for future exploration)
- Excel/CSV file manipulation

## 🧹 Topics Covered

- Data loading from CSV and Excel
- Handling missing data and outliers
